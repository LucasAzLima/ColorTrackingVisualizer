# 3D Painting Tool with Computer Vision Depth Tracking

This repository contains the source code for my **Undergraduate Thesis (TCC)** in Computer Engineering at the **Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN)**.

The project integrates **OpenCV** and **OpenGL** to build an interactive system capable of real-time color tracking and 3D visualization. It allows users to draw in a three-dimensional virtual space using only a standard camera and computer vision algorithms ‚Äî without requiring expensive depth sensors.

## üìñ Overview

* **Computer Vision (OpenCV):** Captures images in real time, applies color detection, contour extraction, and depth estimation.
* **3D Graphics (OpenGL + GLUT):** Renders a 3D environment where tracked objects are visualized and manipulated interactively.
* **Depth Calculation:** The Z-axis (depth) is estimated using the relative size of tracked objects.
* **Multithreading in C++:** Ensures synchronization between OpenCV (vision) and OpenGL (graphics) modules for real-time responsiveness.

This project demonstrates how accessible technologies can be combined to create low-cost interactive 3D systems, with potential applications in **education, simulations, and interactive art**.

## üöÄ Features

* Real-time **color tracking** of multiple objects.
* Conversion of tracked positions into **3D coordinates (X, Y, Z)**.
* Interactive **3D visualization and drawing** inside a cubic virtual environment.
* Camera-based **depth estimation** without specialized sensors.
* **Mouse interaction** to rotate and explore the 3D scene.

## üì∏ Example

To reproduce these results, run the application, configure the colors to be tracked, and move a colored object (controller) in front of the camera.  
The system will capture the movement in real time and render it inside the 3D cubic environment.

- **User holding the tracked controller:** The system uses a simple colored object as the input device, captured by a standard camera.

- **System interface (camera + 3D cubic environment):** On the right, the camera feed used for color tracking; on the left, the 3D cubic environment rendered with OpenGL, where the tracked object will be visualized.  
  ![System Interface](docs/images/interface.png)

- **Tracking and 3D drawing result:** The tracked controller movements are mapped into 3D coordinates, allowing interactive painting inside the cubic space.
